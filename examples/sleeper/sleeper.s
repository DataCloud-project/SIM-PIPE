; here's an example of the smallest program in x86 Assembly that sleeps forever
; until it receives a kill signal:

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  xor eax, eax          ; Set EAX to 0
  mov edx, 0x7fffffff   ; Set EDX to the maximum positive value for a 32-bit register
  int 0x80              ; Make a system call to the Linux kernel


; This code consists of three instructions:

; xor eax, eax: This instruction sets the EAX register to 0 using a bitwise exclusive or
; (XOR) operation. The XOR operation between a register and itself always sets the register to 0.

; mov edx, 0x7fffffff: This instruction sets the EDX register to the maximum positive value that
; can be stored in a 32-bit register, 0x7fffffff.

; int 0x80: This instruction is a software interrupt that invokes a system call to the
; Linux kernel. The value in the EAX register specifies the system call to be made, and the value
; in the EDX register is an argument to the system call. In this case, EAX is set to 0, which
; corresponds to the pause system call, and EDX is set to 0x7fffffff, which specifies the maximum
; amount of time the program should sleep.

; This program uses the pause system call to cause the program to sleep until a signal is
; received. When a signal is received, the program resumes execution from the point where it was
; paused. This allows the program to sleep without using any CPU time, and it will continue to
; sleep until it receives a kill signal or another signal that wakes it up.
