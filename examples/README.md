# SIM-PIPE Example

## Running your first data pipeline simulation

After SIM-PIPE has been installed, you are ready to run your first data pipeline dry run!

In the main page of SIM-PIPE, go to *Projects* and select the *Create* button to create a new project. To try one of the examples in this repository, enter a project name and choose one of the example templates in the folders under this page.

Additionally, SIM-PIPE is compatible with Argo workflows and can use official Argo project examples, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/master/examples).
