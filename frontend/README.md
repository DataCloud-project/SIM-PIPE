# SIM-PIPE User Interface

The front-end subcomponent will be integrated with the DEF-PIPE user interface and use [AppSmith](http://appsmith.com). The specific interactions will be as follows:
-	Simulation APIs – CRUD operations for a new simulation for a specific pipeline; each simulation consists of a set of “runs” that represent a single execution of the simulation
-	Simulation “run” APIs – Start/stop/retrieve information related to a simulation run (current or historical)
-	Simulation “run” information – retrieve files and metrics related to a specific run
